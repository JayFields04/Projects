# Data Visualization

These are the steps that I took in order to create a static website and host it using Amazon S3 and Amazon Quicksight. I am using the data set provided in the "Step #1" section below, that provides information about Motor Vehicle Collisions in NYC.

## Step #1: Download the Dataset
This is the dataset that I had used for this project.
[Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes Data Set](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes)

## Step #2: Store Dataset in Amazon S3
[Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## Step #3: Connect S3 Bucket with Amazon Quicksight
[Amazon Quicksight Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/)
