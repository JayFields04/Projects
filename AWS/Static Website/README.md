# Static Website Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a static website and hosting it using Amazon S3 and Route 53.

## Step #1: Purchase a Custom Domain through Amazon Route 53
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises.
[Amazon Route 53 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/)

 - For this example I will be using [JayFieldsProject.click](jayfieldsproject.click)

## Step #2: Design Your Website

 - Design your own personal website or download an existing template

## Step #3: Set Up Amazon S3 Bucket
Amazon S3 is an object storage service
[Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/)

 - Here I will be enabling the Static website hosting and uploading website files to the bucket
