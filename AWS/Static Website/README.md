# Static Website Deployment

These are the steps that I took in order to create a static website and host it using Amazon S3 and Route 53.

## Step #1: Purchase a Custom Domain through Amazon Route 53
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises.

 - For this example I will be using [JayFieldsProject.click](http://jayfieldsproject.click/)

## Step #2: Design Your Website

 - Design your own personal website or download an existing template

## Step #3: Set Up Amazon S3 Bucket
Amazon S3 is an object storage service
